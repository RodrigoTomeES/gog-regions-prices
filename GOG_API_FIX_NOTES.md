# GOG API Fix - Technical Notes

## Issue
The GOG API integration was failing due to:
1. **Deprecated Request Library**: The code was using the deprecated `request` library
2. **Single Endpoint Dependency**: Only one API endpoint was hardcoded
3. **Poor Error Handling**: Limited visibility into API failures

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Replaced Deprecated `request` with `axios`
- Migrated from `request` (deprecated) to `axios` (modern, actively maintained)
- Added proper timeout and error handling
- Improved HTTP header configuration

### 2. Added Fallback Endpoint Support
The system now tries multiple potential GOG API endpoints in order:
1. `https://www.gog.com/games/ajax/filtered` (original)
2. `https://gog.com/games/ajax/filtered` (without www)
3. `https://api.gog.com/games/filtered` (API subdomain)
4. `https://www.gog.com/api/games/filtered` (with /api/ path)

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Better error messages with specific failure reasons
- Graceful fallback when endpoints fail
- Improved logging for debugging API issues

### 4. Modern HTTP Headers
Added proper headers that modern APIs expect:
- User-Agent string
- Accept headers
- X-Requested-With for AJAX identification

## Files Modified
- `src/extract.js` - Main extraction logic updated
- `package.json` - Added axios dependency

## Testing
The changes maintain backward compatibility with the existing data format while providing more resilient API access.

## Future Improvements
If GOG continues to change their API, consider:
1. Adding API key authentication if required
2. Implementing rate limiting to prevent blocking
3. Adding configuration file for endpoint management
4. Monitoring API endpoint health
